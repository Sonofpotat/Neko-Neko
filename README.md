# LiveView-Template
You can use this as a template to create a LiveView app!

Whenever you need to create a new Elixir app that uses LiveView, you can use this repo as a template, instead of creating an app from scratch.
The template already has postgres dependencies removed and is configured to accept connections from any IP.

To create a new repo from the template:
- Click the "Use this template" button on GitHub
- Create a new repository
